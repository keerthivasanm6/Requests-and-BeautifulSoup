Learning the beautiful soup Library and its nuances of scrapping the website

BeautifulSoup is a Python Library and its helpful to scrape a static website say like HTML,XML
Its parses the website and make a tree like structure so we can easily navigate within the HTML codes.
Basically easy to find the tags,attributes,txt,links etc...so easy dude
But bro,
We need request library as well, because it will make a request and fetch the website that we want to scrape before using beautifulsoup
Web Scraping is like using the spoon..just take what you need
